# CG-Lab
Repo for CG-Lab assignments

## How to set it up
* Download the GitPod extension for your browser [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki?hl=en "here")
* A Gitpod button should now be present right next to the ```code``` button (where we clone the repo from).
* Click on ```Gitpod``` and it should open VSCode in a new tab with the current repo.

## How to Run the code
* Run the output file for any assignment in the terminal as ```./<filename>_output.exe```
* If the output file does not already exist, create one by running ```g++ <filename>.cpp -o <filename>_output.exe```
